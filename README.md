## 🔍 Key Insights Discovered

- 🏬 **Heartland malls** saw higher transaction volumes than centrally located malls — presenting opportunities for targeted marketing or mall partnerships to capture untapped demand.  
- 🍽️ **Food and groceries** were the most common expense types. Collaborating with popular mall merchants to launch reward programs (e.g. loyalty points for card usage) could increase customer retention.  
- 🧾 **Instalment transactions** made up the highest total spending amount by category. Further analysis could identify what types of instalments are popular — opening avenues for product partnerships or promotional offers.
